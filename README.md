<!-- PROJECT DESCRIPTION -->

# 📖 About the Project <a name="about-project"></a>

**Employee Management App** is a web application built with React and a backend server using Node.js and MySQL. The app allows users to manage a list of employees, including adding new employees, updating their information, and deleting employees. It provides a simple user interface to interact with the employee data and perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.

# 🚀 Getting Started <a name="getting-started"></a>

To get a local copy up and running, follow these steps.

### Prerequisites

Before running the app, ensure you have the following installed:

- Node.js
- MySQL database

### Setup

1. Clone this repository to your desired folder:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/cilfonegabriel/crud-staff.git
cd crud-staff


### Install

After cloning the repo, navigate into it and install all the required packages with the following command:

```sh
cd client
npm install

cd server
npm install

```

Then just wait for everything to finish downloading.

### Usage

In the project directory, you can run backend server with the following command:

`node index.js`

In a separate terminal, start the React app:

`npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

`npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

### Run tests

To run tests, run the following command:

`npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### Deployment

You can deploy this project using:

`npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
